# Documents 

Service Fabric Mesh documentation is organized in the following two broad categories.

  [**1. Conceptual docs**](./conceptual-docs)

  The conceptual documentation provides an overview of the Service Fabric Mesh project and the scope of the preview program. If you are new to the platform, conceptual documentation is a great place to start. It includes quick starts and samples for you to get started with using the platform.
  
  [**2. Reference docs**](./reference-docs)

  The reference documentation provides detailed documentation for the REST APIs and the CLI.
