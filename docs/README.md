# Documents 

SeaBreeze documentation is organized in the following two broad categories.

1. Conceptual documentation:
The conceptual documentations provide an overview of the SeaBreeze project and the scope of the preview program. If you are new to the platform, conceptual documentation is a great place to start. It includes quick starts and samples for you to get started with using the platform. 

2. Reference documentation:
The reference documentation provides detailed documentation for the REST APIs and the CLI.

The SeaBreeze team is looking forward to your feedback. [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/seabreeze-preview-pr/issues) is the place to go to for filing any bugs (code or documentation) you come across, or improvements you would like to request.
