# Tutorial: Debug an Azure Service Fabric application

This tutorial is part two of a series and shows you how to debug an Azure Service Fabric application on your local development cluster.

In this tutorial you will learn:

> * What happens when you build an Azure Service Fabric application
> * How to set a breakpoint to observe a service-to-service call

In this tutorial series you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * [Build a Service Fabric application](service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-create-dotnetcore.md)
> * Debug the app locally
> * [Publish the app to Azure](service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-deploy-service-fabric-mesh-app.md)

[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/include-preview-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial:

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

* Make sure that you've [set up your development environment](service-fabric-mesh-setup-developer-environment-sdk.md) which includes installing the Service Fabric runtime, SDK, Docker, and Visual Studio 2017.

## Download the to-do sample application

If you did not create the to-do sample application in [part one of this tutorial series](service-fabric-mesh-tutorial-create-dotnetcore.md), you can download it. In a command window, run the following command to clone the sample app repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/azure-samples/service-fabric-mesh
```

The application is under the `basicservicefabricmeshapp` directory.

## Build and debug on your local cluster

A Docker image is automatically built and deployed to your local cluster as soon as your project loads. This process may take a while. To monitor the progress in the Visual Studio **Output** pane, set the Output pane **Show output from:** drop-down to **Service Fabric Tools**.

Press **F5** to compile and run your service locally. Whenever the project is run and debugged locally, Visual Studio will:

* Make sure that Docker for Windows is running and set to use Windows as the container operating system.
* Download any missing Docker base images. This part may take some time
* Build (or rebuild) the Docker image used to host your code project.
* Deploy and run the container on the local Service Fabric development cluster.
* Run your services and hit any breakpoints you have set.

After the local deployment is finished, and Visual Studio is running your app, a browser window will open to a default sample web page.

**Debugging tips**

* If you get the **No Service Fabric local cluster is running** error, make sure that the Service Local Custer Manager (SLCM) is running and right-click the SLCM icon in the task bar, then click **Start Local Cluster**. Once it has started, return to Visual Studio and press **F5**.
* If you get a **404** error when the app starts, it probably means that your environment variables in **service.yaml** are incorrect. Make sure that `AppName`, `ApiHostPort` and `ServiceName` are set correctly per the instructions in [Set environment variables](#set-environment-variables).
* If you get build errors in **service.yaml**, make sure that spaces, not tabs, are used to indent the lines.

### Debug in Visual Studio

When you debug a Service Fabric application in Visual Studio, you are using a local Service Fabric development cluster. To see how to-do items are retrieved from the back-end service, debug into the OnGet() method.
1. In the **WebFrontEnd** project, open **Pages** > **Index.cshtml** > **Index.cshtml.cs** and set a breakpoint in the **Get** method (line 17).
2. In the **ToDoService** project, open **TodoController.cs** and set a breakpoint in the **OnGet** method (line 15).
3. Go back to the browser and refresh the page. You hit the  breakpoint in the web front end `OnGet()` method. You can inspect the `backendUrl` variable to see how the environment variables that you defined in the **service.yaml** file are combined into the URL used to contact the back-end service.
4. Step over (F10) the `client.GetAsync(backendUrl).GetAwaiter().GetResult())` call and you'll hit the controller's `Get()` breakpoint. In this method, you can see how the list of to-do items is retrieved from the in-memory list.
5. When you are done, stop debugging your project in Visual Studio by pressing **Shift+F5**.
