# ServiceFabricMeshApp

Create an Azure Service Fabric app that has an ASP.NET web front end and an ASP.NET Core Web API back-end service.
You'll debug the app on your local development cluster and publish the app to Azure.
When you're finished, you'll have a simple to-do app that demonstrates a service-to-service call in a Service Fabric Mesh app.
